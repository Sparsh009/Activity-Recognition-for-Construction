# Activity-Recognition-for-Construction
This project implements activity recognition for construction sites using deep learning models, including YOLOv9 for object detection and CNN-LSTM for activity recognition. The goal is to classify different types of construction-related activities and ensure safety compliance on-site through real-time video analytics.
